## Codebase Patterns
- Use `[[ $# -gt 0 ]]` with `shift` for bash flag parsing
- Regex `^[1-9][0-9]*$` validates positive integers (excludes 0 and negatives)

- Refactored ralph.sh to use named `--prompt` and `--max-iterations` flags
- Replaced positional `$1` with while-loop flag parser
- Added validation for positive integer on max-iterations
- Files changed: ralph.sh
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The script uses `PROMPT_FILE` variable for the prompt path - use this for US-002 path validation
  - Default prompt is `$SCRIPT_DIR/prompt.md`

- Added prompt file validation with `[ ! -f "$PROMPT_FILE" ]` check
- Exits with code 1 and clear error message showing which file was not found
- Files changed: ralph.sh
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Validation order matters: validate max-iterations first (it's simpler), then prompt file
  - Relative paths work automatically since bash resolves them from CWD
